We hope that you will choose to personalize your experience on our website/portal, and take advantage of the information and special offers that can be provided to you by registering on our site. If you would rather not participate, or if you think that we have information about you that is incorrect or you would like to change the information we have about you (if you re-locate, for example), let us know by contacting us.
If you choose to register on our site, we may ask you to provide certain information about yourself (for example, your name, address, email address, or other information) and/or your company so that we may learn more about what interests you or your company and so that you and/or your company can be contacted in the future (for example, for special offers).<br>
Our website/portal uses "cookies." A cookie is an application that allows a site to be customized to the preferences of the user by placing a small file on the hard drive of your computer, tracking the user's navigation, and storing information about it. For example, cookies may allow you to keep from having to re-type your user name every time you access a website/portal. If you are registered on our website/portal, this information is personally identifiable. If you would rather not let us personalize your experience by using cookies, most web browsers have features that can inform you when a cookie is being sent and can allow users to opt-out of receiving cookies. If you are unsure of whether your program has this capability, you should contact the software manufacturer or your Internet service provider.<br>
In order to improve our website/portal and respond to the interests of our customers, we also collect certain information about the visits to our website/portal by both members and non-members. For example, we may collect the domain name from which you access the Internet (e.g. "aol.com" for users accessing the Internet through America Online), as well as other information. If you are not a registered user on our website/portal, this information is not identified to you personally. If you are a registered user, this information will be identifiable through the use of cookies.<br>
We plan to use the information we collect in connection with updates, offers, and promotions made available to our customers and members. If you are interested, we will keep you informed of special offers on products and services offered to our members (for example we may send you an email or update your personalized screen).
We will also occasionally compile aggregate information (i.e., information that does not identify any specific information that reflects the identity of an individual customer or member) for internal use at our institution or to share with advertisers or other third-parties to help them become more familiar with our company and audience.
Because we are continually striving to offer more features and services to our customers and website/portal members, we may change our policy with respect to how we use your personal information. In the event that we change our practices, we will post a notice on this website/portal, and we will provide you with the ability to "opt-out" of any changes.
When you choose to explore other venues on the Internet, the operators of the other websites/portal may have different privacy and data collection practices. We recommend that as you explore the Internet, you are aware of the privacy policies of other websites/portal you visit. We cannot ensure that any site linked to or accessible from our page will protect your personal information and we cannot take responsibility for the practices of other websites/portal.<br>
