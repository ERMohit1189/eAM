								<ul>
                                    <li>Proper development of a child depends mainly on two factors - your supervision
                                    at home and ours at school. If either is lacking, the progress of your ward suffers. We expect you to 
                                    cooperate with the school authorities in enforcing regularity, discipline and habit to study and prepare 
                                    lessons with keen interest among your wards.</li>
                                    <li>Student's home-work diary must be checked and signed daily. It is an important
                                    medium of communication between you and the teachers.</li>

                                    <li>You are required to notify the school of any change in the address immediately.</li>
                                    <li>You are required to acquaint yourself thoroughly with the rules and regulations of 
                                    the school as well as other details and to maintain cordial relations with the school staff.</li>
                                    <li>Students must not be disturbed in course of studies during school hours by the 
                                    parents / guardians/ relatives. Parent-teacher meeting is the proper venue for holding discussions. 
                                    However, in case of any exigencyNri5r permission of the Principal is necessary.</li>
                                    <li>Tuition by or teachers is specifically prohibited. Students who want to improve
                                    if they are not making satisfactory progress can avail the facility of remedial and extra classes 
                                    conducted by our teachers absolutely free of any charge.</li>
                                    <li>No member of the teaching staff is permitted to visit the homes of the students
                                    for any reason, -whatsoever.</li>
                                    <li>Criticism of a teacher or .school, particularly in the presence of a student is
                                    extremely undesirable and even harmful as it creates disregard for the teachers. Unwanted and superfluous
                                    rumors’ cause immense damage to the building of personality cult of the students.</li>
                                    <li>It should always be kept in mind that we are all linked together in a 
                                    continuous progress of educating the children. Hence cordial relations must be maintained at all levels,
                                    realizing that the net result of recriminations falls on the child.</li>
